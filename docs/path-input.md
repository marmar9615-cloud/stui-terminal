# Path Input

`st.path_input` is a post-v2 experimental, text-first widget for local paths.
It returns a normalized absolute string and does not read the selected file's
content.

```python
import stui as st

artifact = st.path_input(
    "Artifact",
    "build/report.json",
    root="workspace",
    kind="file",
    must_exist=True,
    extensions=["json"],
    key="artifact",
)
```

The experimental signature is:

```python
st.path_input(
    label,
    value="",
    *,
    root=None,
    kind="any",
    must_exist=False,
    extensions=None,
    browse=True,
    key=None,
    disabled=False,
    on_change=None,
    args=None,
    kwargs=None,
) -> str
```

## Resolution

- Relative `root` values resolve from the app script's directory.
- Relative input values resolve from `root`, or from the app script's directory
  when `root` is omitted.
- Absolute values remain absolute.
- `~` expands using the current user's home directory.
- Environment variables such as `$HOME` and `%USERPROFILE%` are not expanded.
- `.` and `..` are normalized lexically. Symlinks are not resolved, so the
  returned string preserves the symlink path the user entered.
- An empty value remains `""`; non-empty values return as absolute strings.

`root` is a resolution and future browsing location. It is **not a security
sandbox**. An absolute value, `~`, or `..` may point outside `root`. Applications
that need an authorization boundary must enforce one separately.

## Validation

Validation runs when the value is committed through the normal widget rerun
pipeline. A validation problem appears below the field, while the widget still
returns and stores the normalized string.

- `kind="file"` requires an existing value to be a file.
- `kind="directory"` requires an existing value to be a directory.
- `kind="any"` accepts either.
- `must_exist=True` rejects empty, missing, deleted, and broken-symlink targets.
- Existing targets must be readable.
- `extensions` accepts one extension or an iterable. Values may be written as
  `"json"`, `".json"`, or `"*.json"`; matching is case-insensitive.
- Extension filters apply to `kind="file"` and to existing files when
  `kind="any"`. They do not reject directories.

Validation inspects filesystem metadata only. It does not call `open`, read
bytes or text, execute a shell command, upload a path, or start a server.

## State And Forms

An explicit `key` uses the same `session_state`, duplicate-key, callback, and
focus behavior as other stui widgets. `on_change` runs after the normalized
value is stored and receives `args` and `kwargs`.

Inside `st.form`, edits and callbacks remain pending until
`st.form_submit_button` commits the form. A disabled path input ignores pending
edits. Terminal control characters are rendered as visible escape text before
they can reach widget state or callbacks.

## Browsing And Platforms

The `browse` flag is retained in the experimental call shape, but this initial
implementation deliberately ships only the reliable text-plus-validation
workflow. `browse=True` and `browse=False` currently render the same text field;
there is no file-browser overlay yet.

Path parsing follows the host operating system. Drive and UNC paths are native
on Windows; backslashes remain ordinary filename characters on POSIX systems.
The API is Streamlit-inspired, but it is not Streamlit-compatible and does not
depend on Streamlit at runtime.
